# pythonBattleship

Hello!

This is a mini-ish project that I had created back in high-school using python. As seen by the title, this is a python battleship game that allows you
to play a game of battleship against the computer. Using RNG, the computer randomly selects spots for their ships and the player tries to guess where 
they are accordingly!
